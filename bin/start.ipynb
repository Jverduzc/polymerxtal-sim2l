    "The PolymerXtal SimTool is based on PolymerXtal software designed to build and analyze molecular-level polymer crystal structures. PolymerXtal provides a standardized process to generate polymer crystal structure based on monomer, tacticity, helicity, chiriality and unit cell information and analyze the crystallinity in polymer systems with given atom trajectories. These features have allowed PolymerXtal to lead further investigations of semi-crystalline polymers where most properties are governed by the crystalline microstructure and promote future research endeavors in the area of crystalline polymer simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, users need to specify as inputs the polymer type they wish to run, the helice structure, tacticity and chiriality. The SimTool generates the chain helix structure and a visual snapshot of it."

    "SimTools can be created in any notebook.  The inputs and (later) outputs are defined in the notebook and the notebook controls the running of the simulation and  the saving of results.  Optionally a SimTool Builder can be  used to interactively create a notebook that can then be edited and finished.  We have not defined the publishing process, but they will likely just be a new kind of tool in /apps.  SimTools can be tested by just running the notebook.  We will have an automatic web api for published SimTools."

    "**The source code does not show how these tools will be developed in the future**.  Instead we will use YAML to define all the parameters in the GUI, with the same syntax as the SimTool.  Then we will have an optional Layout YAML description of how the GUI should look.  For example, we will select a template (TabbedTool, Wizard, etc) and extra items to include (images, animations, anything not an input parameter).  Then we use simple lists to indicate which items are grouped together and which Tab or Page they are on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For outputs, we will have a default layout, very much like Rappture.  And some optional layouts, or the developer can write a custom one.\n",

    "Limitations:  Jupyter cells expand vertically as needed.  The ipywidgets do not understand about strecthing to fill vertical space, like they do horizintally.  This places some restrictions on intelligent resizing.  This can and should be fixed as the Jupyter community works adds support for apps (or dashboards)."
