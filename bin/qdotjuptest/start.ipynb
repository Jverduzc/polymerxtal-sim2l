Optionally a SimTool Builder can be  used to interactively create a notebook that can then be edited and finished.  We have not defined the publishing process, but they will likely just b a new kind of tool in /apps.  SimTools can be tested by just running the notebook.  We will have an automatic web api for published SimTools.\n",

Then we will have an optional Layout YAML description of how the GUI should look.  For example, we will select a template (TabbedTool, Wizard, etc) and extra items to include (images, animations, anything not an input parameter).  Then we use simple lists to indicate which items are grouped together and which Tab or Page they are on.\n",

This places some restrictions on intelligent resizing.  This can and should be fixed as the Jupyter community works adds support for apps (or dashboards)."
